Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Tooling Rules

### 1. File discovery — use the `fff` MCP tools

Use the `fff` MCP tools for all file discovery and file search operations instead of shell commands or the default tools:

- `find_files` — find files by name, glob, or path prefix → **replaces `ls`, `find`, and `tree`**.
- `grep` — search file contents for an identifier → replaces `grep` / `rg`.
- `multi_grep` — OR-search several identifiers in one call.

Do not use `ls` or `find` to list or explore the filesystem; use `find_files` instead. Only fall back to a shell command when `fff` cannot express the operation.

### 2. Library & API knowledge — `context7` first, then `deepwiki`

When the behavior, API, configuration, or usage of a library, framework, SDK, or CLI tool is unclear, do not guess — look it up. Use the MCP documentation servers in this order:

1. **`context7` MCP** — resolve the library with `resolve-library-id`, then query it with `query-docs`. Preferred for concrete API syntax, setup/configuration, version-specific behavior, and current official examples.
2. **`deepwiki` MCP** — if `context7` has no coverage, or the question is about a GitHub repository's architecture, internals, or design rationale, use `read_wiki_structure` / `read_wiki_contents`.

Fall back to prior knowledge only when both sources are exhausted or the API is trivial and stable.

### 3. Shell commands — always use `rtk`

`rtk` is a token-optimized CLI proxy that filters and summarizes command output before it reaches the model context (up to ~90% fewer output tokens).

> **Status:** rtk's automatic hook/plugin integration does **not** support OpenCode v2 yet. Until it does, the rules in this file are the mechanism — apply the `rtk` prefix manually on every command.

**Rule:** whenever `rtk` is installed, run shell commands through its subcommands instead of the native binaries — for example `rtk git status` instead of `git status`.

> Exception: for listing and locating files, the `fff` tools from section 1 take precedence over `rtk ls` / `rtk find`. Use the `rtk` wrappers for everything else and whenever a shell command is genuinely required.

**Availability check (once per session):**

```bash
rtk --version 2>/dev/null || echo "rtk unavailable"
```

- Prints `rtk <version>` → `rtk` is available: use the `rtk` form for every command in the mapping below.
- `command not found` or non-zero exit → fall back to the native commands for the rest of the session. Do not retry `rtk` on every call.

#### Notes

- `rtk` subcommands pass native flags through: `rtk ls -la`, `rtk grep -i -A 3 "foo" src/`, `rtk git diff --staged` all work.
- For listing files or building a tree, prefer `fff find_files` (section 1). `rtk ls`, `rtk tree`, and `rtk find` are the shell fallback and proxy the native tools.
- Meta/analytics commands are always called directly on `rtk`: `rtk gain`, `rtk gain --history`, `rtk discover`, `rtk config`.
- If `rtk` filtering hides information you need (e.g. exact file contents with line numbers), re-run with the native command or `rtk read --level none -n`.
- Do not wrap commands that `rtk` does not support. If no rtk subcommand exists, run the native command directly.
- Do **not** rely on `rtk init --opencode`: the OpenCode hook/plugin is not supported on OpenCode v2 yet. Once support lands, the automatic rewrite can replace the manual prefixing described here.

⚠️ **Name collision:** if `rtk gain` fails, a different `rtk` (reachingforthejack/rtk, "Rust Type Kit") may be on `PATH`. Verify with `which rtk`; if it is the wrong binary, fall back to the native commands.

### 4. Memory — use the `oc2-memory` plugin **frequently**

`oc2-memory` is installed in this environment and is this project's memory layer. Use it by default, not as a last resort: an agent that never reads or writes memory re-derives context that already exists and loses decisions that were already made. The raw tool list lives in `mem.md`.

**Read before you work:**

- `memory_search` — before planning non-trivial work, search for prior decisions, gotchas, project facts, and user preferences.
- `memory_read` — pull a specific file (`long_term`, `scratchpad`, `daily`, `list`) when you need the full text.

**Write when you learn something durable:**

- `memory_write` with `target: "long_term"` — decisions, architecture facts, conventions, user preferences, recurring bug classes. Append mode is the default; search first so you do not duplicate.
- `memory_write` with `target: "daily"` — session progress, open threads, transient notes.
- `scratchpad` (`add` / `done` / `undo` / `clear_done` / `list`) — small "fix later" items you do not want to lose mid-task.

**Maintain:**

- `memory_status` — health check: where files live, qmd / collection / embeddings state.
- `memory_forget` / `memory_restore` — remove outdated or wrong facts, then restore them via the returned recovery ID if needed.

**Where it lives:** `~/.pi/agent/memory/` (shared pi memory) — `MEMORY.md` (long-term), `SCRATCHPAD.md`, daily logs. Falls back to `~/.oc2-memory/` when the pi directory does not exist; `PI_MEMORY_DIR` overrides both.

**Rules:**

- **Before a decision, search.** Whenever a decision is coming up — architecture, library choice, convention, workflow, trade-off — run `memory_search` first with a few relevant keywords. Prior context may already settle it.
- **When a decision is made or a new insight appears, store it.** Do not leave it in the chat: `memory_write` the decision (what, why, alternatives rejected) or the finding, while the context is still fresh.
- Search before writing; never append a duplicate fact.
- Write facts and decisions, not narration — one self-contained entry per item.
- Prefer the plugin over ad-hoc notes in chat or in scratch files.
